# IWD senior *fullstack* challenge backend part

## Setup

To avoid losing time, we have setup a Silex boilerplate to handle HTTP request/response.

> The choice of Silex is arbitrary, we could have used Symfony, Laravel,
> whatever the frameworks... We are not interested in finding a master of
> frameworks, but a developer who knows how to code business rules so that they
> can be maintained over time.

```bash
cd fullstack/senior/backend
composer install
php -S localhost:8080 -t web web/index.php

#Go to http://localhost:8080, you will see "Status OK"
```

## Guidelines

We want to see your skills to design business code to produce **efficient** and
**maintainable** code over time. This exercise might seem simple and some
shortcuts can be used to develop these features quickly but we are more
interested in how you might structure your code and classes if these features
were to be just the **beginning of a larger project** destined to **evolve in
time**.

DO
* Do use good design
* Do maintainable design
* Do use unit tests
* Do use dependency management
* Do use consistent code styles
* Do use others dependencies if you want/need it
* Follow PSR-x
* Show the Business in your code

DON'T DO
* Do not loose time with optimization
* Do not use Docker, Vagrant... we must be able to run the api only with the PHP server

## Data

The data folder contains some JSON files. Think of it as a database or any other
persistence system. This is a list of survey answers by a sales man. Different
surveys are identified by the code (think of it as the id). Answers will be
aggregated by survey code.

You have 2 kinds of questions:

* qcm: the answer is an array of `true`/`false` (based on the `option` array)
* number: the answer is a `number`

## The Test

To build a web app we need a REST like API to expose an aggregation of answers
by survey code.

The aggregation will be different depending on the question type:

* qcm: how much `Product 1`, how much `Product 2`...
* number: the **average** of all answers

> Note: for now, there are only 2 types of question, but we know that more will
> be added in a very near future with different aggregation rules, so your code
> has to take that constraint into account.

The API result is not defined, do what you want, be creative and data centric.
